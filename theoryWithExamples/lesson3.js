// Core types in typescript

//1. Number  : ---> 1,2,3,           ---> All number no differentiate between numbers
//2. String  : "hell",'helo',`hlo`,  ---> All text values
//3. Boolean : true or false ,       ---> truthy or falsy values

// typesrcipt system is help during the development ( before code gets compiled )

// Typescript vs javascript
// JavaScript is dynamically types its means suppose a vairable initially hode a number  we can
// later assign to string  that's why we have typeOf operator in javascript


// typesrcipt is statically typed they doesn't change during the run time
// example
